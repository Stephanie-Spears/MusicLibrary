/*DESTRUCTOR NOTES:

The destructor deallocates the memory occupied by the nodes of a list
when the class object goes out of scope. Because memory is allocated
dynamically, resetting the pointers first and last does not deallocate
the memory occupied by the noes in the list. We must traverse the list,
starting at the first node, and delete each node in the list. The list
can be destroyed by calling the function destroyList. Therefore, the
definition of the destructor is:

template <class Type>
linkedListType<Type>::~linkedListType()
{
destroyList();
}

		but by using "const Song &aSong" the function can't change the value.
		*NOTE: you CAN'T pass a const argument to a non-const reference parameter, so using const parameters ensures you can pass both non-const AND const arguments to the function.
		-when passing an argument by reference, always use a const reference unless you need to change the value of the argument.

		SongList function ::addSong does the following:
		-Takes the passed in const parameter "aSong" and runs the Song::getTitle(title) function, where "title" is a local variable inside addSong.
		-this sets the local variable "title" to the value stored in the member function "this->title"
		-Next, it takes SongList member pointer (of type Song) "list" and runs: list[size].setTitle(title);
		-this takes list and runs the function setTitle(title).
		*remember that setTitle(title) first checks if the member var this->title is empty. then it allocates a new memory address that's the array size of the local var "title" +1 (null-terminated), and then copies local var "title" into member var "this->title"
		FINALLY addSong(aSong) increments "size". size++.*/
